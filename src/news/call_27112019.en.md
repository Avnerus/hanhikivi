**Invitation for Artist and Researchers**

Co-operative Noidanlukko and Information Center Hanhikivi situated in
Pyhäjoki, Finland, invite artists and researchers to apply their own work methods on the
human-nature relationship and the environmental impacts of the planned nuclear power project in the municipality of Pyhäjoki in Northern Ostrobothnia. We are searching for groups, individuals, research projects and networks and we aim at co-operation with independent individuals or entities. We offer residency at the cottage of the Information Center Hanhikivi; the house and the yard situated close to the center of the small countryside municipality is suitable especially for small workshop meetings, journalistic and documentation work or small exhibitions and events.

***This call is open until 31st of March 2020.***

*You can send your application by mail: infocenterhanhikivi
(at)riseup.net. Please read this whole invitation text first.*

\
*The possibilities of the activities of the Information Center Hanhikivi
vary, and are dependent on the sale of the co-operative shares. The
house offers space for *accommodation and events. At summertime, also the yard with its trees
and space for garden are at use. The activities are built always as volunteer work,
and for example moderate daily food or firewood costs are shared among participants.
Food, heating and accommodation costs are about 9-15 euros per day, depending on the
situation.*

You are welcome to share this invitation, and to join building our
collective project!

We welcome art and research professionals, but also any project that
stems from an idea,

group skills, search for knowledge, need to express or pure intuition.
The most important thing is that you can describe your project, goals
and actions beforehand and the project can be accepted to be included in
the goals of the Co-operative Noidanlukko and the practical rules of the
Information Center house. We are interested, for example, in different
environmental protection projects, monitoring the state of environment
and documenting the changes in the environment.

**The goal of the Information Center Hanhikivi is to learn and inform
better on the damages to the society and nature that a nuclear power project causes.**

We are searching for ways to repair some of the damages done in Pyhäjoki. Our call is also inviting
work, that brings forth the more vast problems of nuclear power
projects, including economical unprofitability, creating dependency on
nuclear power industry, supplanting ecological alternatives, and the
oppression and damage towards people, nature and the peace between
nations.\
Alternative plans should be made for Hanhikivi Cape, supporting
ecological energy production, such as wind, solar and biomass energy,
and the sea area shared with Sweden should be utilised and protected.

**Co-operative Noidanlukko can offer:**

• support of Information Center Hanhikivi according to the resources of
the time

• events and gatherings in Pyhäjoki and the area, where to implement art

and research or to gather or distribute information

• the countryside house yard, where to realise experiments based on
ecologically sustainable living

• activities, that respect peace in the neighbourhood, nature and
animals

• athmosphere, that encourages citizens to gather information, assess
information

critically themselves and to be active

• attitude, where everyone is equal in learning and sharing experience
and information

• Internet pages to disseminate nuclear power critical information

We encourage to creativity, humour and to interdisciplinary and artistic
methods. The joining entities must approve the goals and principles of
the Cooperative Noidanlukko. We can offer our support to projects that
last until the end of year 2021 at the latest. The cooperative does not
have any paid work, it can unfortunately not promise financial support
and the project is at the responsibility of the entity that realises it.

We do offer our space, networks, support to non-profit work and our
trust to human inventiveness to turn around the exploitative machineries, towards a more ecological and more equal world that is concerned with the rights and lives of future generations.
