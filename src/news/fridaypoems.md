# Alternatives?

It is gonna be nuclear power,

Tears run like fall-out shower,

Citizen votes denied,

Land owners cried,

Planning meetings with quasi participation,

Rubber stamps for the only formulation,

_Itâ€™s not a fair fight,_

_Only one option is perceived as right,

_At the cabinets alternatives non-existent,

_How could the suits be fought from a tent?

_When opponents are perceived as option zero,

_Your neighbour turns to anti-hero,

_Even our researcher friend seems to hesitate,

_Is he not afraid of nuclear waste?

 
 

_Billion euros project,

_High hopes on local employment,

_Should make the region thrive,

_Keep the villages alive,

_Media hype around economic opportunities,

_Promoted as common good without alternatives,

_Yet path towards national energy self-sufficiency,

_Turns into security emergency,

_Growing dependency on a military power,

_Is the age of autonomy over?

 
 

_We can fix climate change,

_Never mind the marginalized rage,

_Already before the plant is up,

_People afraid even the local pub,

_Inside families rising fences,

_In vain struggles against senses,

_Opponents targeted by a witch hunt,

_Is there really a social warrant,

_For a biased political foreplay,

_Goose slayed, put on a tray,

 
 

_Do not shoot the white pigeon,

_Imagine responsible growth at the region,

_Thousand and one alternatives,

_There are also corporations like king of thieves,

_Pros and cons in the ring,

_Exclusion was a below belt strategy to win,

_Looks turn to earth,

_Global citizens give birth,

_For hope of fair tomorrow,

_Together me and my bro,
