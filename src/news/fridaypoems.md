# Alternatives?

_It is gonna be nuclear power,_

_Tears run like fall-out shower,_

_Citizen votes denied,_

_Land owners cried,_

_Planning meetings with quasi participation,_

_Rubber stamps for the only formulation,_

_Itâ€™s not a fair fight,_

_Only one option is perceived as right,_

_At the cabinets alternatives non-existent,_

_How could the suits be fought from a tent?_

_When opponents are perceived as option zero,_

_Your neighbour turns to anti-hero,_

_Even our researcher friend seems to hesitate,_

_Is he not afraid of nuclear waste?_

 
 
 
 

_Billion euros project,_

_High hopes on local employment,_

_Should make the region thrive,_

_Keep the villages alive,_

_Media hype around economic opportunities,_

_Promoted as common good without alternatives,_

_Yet path towards national energy self-sufficiency,_

_Turns into security emergency,_

_Growing dependency on a military power,_

_Is the age of autonomy over?_

 
 



_We can fix climate change,_

_Never mind the marginalized rage,_

_Already before the plant is up,_

_People afraid even the local pub,_

_Inside families rising fences,_

_In vain struggles against senses,_

_Opponents targeted by a witch hunt,_

_Is there really a social warrant,_

_For a biased political foreplay,_

_Goose slayed, put on a tray,_

 
 
 
 

_Do not shoot the white pigeon,_

_Imagine responsible growth at the region,_

_Thousand and one alternatives,_

_There are also corporations like king of thieves,_

_Pros and cons in the ring,_

_Exclusion was a below belt strategy to win,_

_Looks turn to earth,_

_Global citizens give birth,_

_For hope of fair tomorrow,_

_Together me and my bro,_
